This is the LAST task given to me in this internship program :

I have to make a video of talking to CEO and CMO about the insights I have gained throughout the program.

Here is what I said :

Greeting:
“Hello, everyone. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to present my findings on our data visualization project.”

“Today, I’ll walk you through the insights derived from our analysis and explain the visuals created based on the data.”

Visuals Overview
Line Chart:

“We start with a line chart to understand the revenue trend for the year 2011. The x-axis represents the invoice dates with monthly granularity, and the y-axis represents the revenue calculated by multiplying Quantity and Unit Price. This visualization helps us see the revenue flow throughout the year and identify peak months.”

Side-by-Side Bar Chart:

“Next, we have a side-by-side bar chart, comparing revenue and quantity for each region. Only the top 10 countries by revenue are shown, excluding the United Kingdom. Each country has two bars – one for revenue and one for quantity, making it easy to compare the financial contributions of each region.”

Column Chart:

“Moving on to a column chart, we have visualized the revenue generated by the top 10 customers, identified from the CustomerID field. Customers without IDs have been excluded, and the chart is sorted in descending order of total revenue. Each bar represents the revenue, highlighting our most valuable customers.”

Map Chart:

“Lastly, the map chart provides a global view of units sold, excluding the United Kingdom. Each country is highlighted with either the total number of units sold or the country’s name, giving us a clear picture of our global reach.”

Data Preparation:

“We began with the initial data load and clean-up steps to ensure accurate analysis. This included filtering data to specific years, calculating revenue, and handling missing CustomerIDs.”

Visual Creation:

“Using the filtered and cleaned data, we created various visuals to answer specific business questions, focusing on regions, customers, and overall revenue trends.”

Conclusion
Summary:

“In summary, these visuals collectively provide comprehensive insights into our sales data, enabling informed decision-making regarding regional performance, customer value, and yearly trends.”

Closing:

“Thank you for your attention. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.”
